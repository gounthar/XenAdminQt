/**
 * @brief TrimSRCommand - Trim (reclaim freed space) from storage repository
 *
 * Qt equivalent of C# XenAdmin.Commands.TrimSRCommand
 *
 * Reclaims freed space from thin-provisioned storage repositories.
 * When VDIs are deleted, the space isn't always immediately returned
 * to the underlying storage. Trim explicitly reclaims that space.
 *
 * Requirements:
 * - SR must support trim (thin-provisioned storage)
 * - SR must be attached to at least one host
 *
 * The command will:
 * - Check if SR supports trim
 * - Show confirmation dialog
 * - Run SrTrimAction to reclaim space
