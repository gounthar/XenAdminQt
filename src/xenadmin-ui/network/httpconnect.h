/**
 * @brief HTTPConnect class - Implements HTTP CONNECT tunneling for XenServer console access
 *
 * This class establishes an HTTP CONNECT tunnel through the XenServer's HTTPS proxy,
 * which is required for accessing VM consoles. Once the tunnel is established, the
 * socket can be used for VNC or RDP protocol communication.
 *
 * ASYNC DESIGN: This class uses non-blocking operations. Connection is established
 * asynchronously and the connectedToConsole() signal is emitted when ready.
 *
 * Based on XenAdmin C# implementation in XenModel/XenAPI/HTTP.cs
